## 2.3 Execution

To provide for a simpler progression through functionality, there are controls
that enable building and executing the minimal code to achieve the goal for a
particular stage. There is a PCD control that platform and board code can use
to limit the scope of what must be functional at a given state of development.
For example, if the board is configured for Stage I functionality, developers
should not be burdened with errors because required porting to make memory
functional has not been done yet. Similarly, initializing memory should not be
burdened with the functionality for authenticating cryptographic hashes
required for Stage V.
